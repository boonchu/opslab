###### Daily linux
I am Redhat Certified Engineer. I am dealing with linux daily user 
case from many users. Sharing what were user requests and how to 
resolve it.
```
Case 1:

User bump into me at the hallway and ask for help. He has new three 
contractors that need access to web service hosts. He has specific
requirements to allow contractors to share files in one location on
/var/share/docs, no one else from his team can be able to access it.

Contractors will be hiring to do the project works for 3 months. The-
account will be expired automatically after contract ends.

/var/share/docs can be either local or network fiel systems. User likely
prefer to keep documents on filer volumes.
```

```
Case 2:

I have request from site operation center to troubleshoot *Red Hat 7* box that 
requires to be single user mode at boot time. You have console access.
```
```
Case 3:
Users want to know what is the best key performance indicator for measuring the 
storage devices when the teams have a plan to purchase them.
```
```
Case 4:
Site operation center have alerts from servers and seems like the file system issue.
While you investigate and found many of file system block error, how can you determine
where is the bad block and which devices hold its problem?
```
```
Case 5:
Customer are suspicious about TCP throughtput from their applications. They want to see
realtime TCP data from live traffic. How can you provide that?

```
Case 6:
In Red Hat 7, sys admin need to configure NIC bonding to extends bandwidth for memcached 
host. SA should be Network Manager utility, no longer needed vim editor.
```
