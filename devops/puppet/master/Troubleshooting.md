* verify cert on master and node
```
- on master
# puppet config print certname
server1.cracker.org
# puppet config print dns_alt_names
server1,server1.cracker.org
- on node
# puppet config print --section agent server
server1.cracker.org
```
* when you see message after running puppet agent -t
```
Exiting; no certificate found and waitforcert is disabled
```
solution:
```
# puppet agent --no-daemonize --onetime --verbose
Exiting; no certificate found and waitforcert is disabledv

# puppet config set certificate_revocation false

# puppet agent --no-daemonize --server server1.cracker.org --onetime --verbose
Exiting; no certificate found and waitforcert is disabled
```
* when you have issue after running puppet agent -t
```
Error: Could not request certificate: The certificate retrieved from the master does not match the agent's private key.

```
solution:
clean up client cert on master, if any
```
$ puppet node deactivate vmk3
$ puppet cert clean vmk3
$ find /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/signed/ -name vmk3.pem -print -delete
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/signed/vmk3.pem
```
clean up client cert on client
```
- centos6/ubuntu instruction
$ service pe-puppet stop
$ find /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl -name vmk3* -print -delete
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/public_keys/vmk3.pem
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/private_keys/vmk3.pem
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/vmk3.pem
$ puppet config set server server1.cracker.org
- note: certname need to match with hostname
$ puppet config print certname prior to running first time puppet agent -t
vmk3
$ service pe-puppet start
$ puppet agent -t
```
[never test - DON't use] if cert clean up on client not helpful, use solution from below to clean up cert and regenerate on master
```
puppet cert clean server1.cracker.org
puppet cert generate server1.cracker.org
systemctl restart pe-httpd
```
* error from puppet agent -t
```
Error: /File[/var/lib/puppet/facts.d]: Could not evaluate: Could not retrieve file metadata for puppet://puppet/pluginfacts: getaddrinfo: Name or service not known

```
* found weird issue from PE puppet since I previously installed standard puppet and overwrite with enterprise edition. When I run the puppet agent -t, it fails and thrown with CA error.
